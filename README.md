# Ludum Dare 28

**Theme: You only get one**

This was my creation for the Ludum Dare competition in December 2013, where the
objective is to create a game in 48 hours.
Everything in this project was written within that 48 hour time period.

The game itself is somewhat uninteresting, but I do take some pride in the
overall structure of the project (considering it's in C).

It was fun, though. I'd do it again, but with more preparation.
